UTS Biomedical Society Bionic Arm Project

This is the file repository for the first student run project lead by the UTS Biomedical Society. 
Our goal for this first project is to, over the course of the uni year, develop a robotic system able to mimic the movements and dexterity of the human arm controllable in real time using electromyography (EMG).
